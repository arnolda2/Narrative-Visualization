# The NBA's Three-Point Revolution

An interactive narrative visualization exploring how the NBA transformed from mid-range to beyond the arc over the past two decades (2004-2024).

## üèÄ Project Overview

This visualization tells the story of how NBA teams shifted from mid-range shots to three-pointers, analyzing:
- **4.2 million shots** across 21 NBA seasons (2004-2024)
- **League-wide trends** showing the rise of three-point shooting
- **Key players** like Stephen Curry who led this revolution
- **Scoring efficiency** improvements from this strategic shift

## üìä Visualization Structure

Built using the **Martini Glass** narrative structure:
1. **Guided narrative** (Scenes 1-4): A controlled sequence revealing the story
2. **Interactive exploration** (Scene 5): User-driven data exploration

### Scenes
1. **Then vs Now**: 2004 vs 2024 shot comparison
2. **The Rising Arc**: League-wide 3PT trends over time
3. **Revolutionary Players**: Focus on Stephen Curry and other leaders
4. **The Efficiency Payoff**: How 3-pointers improved scoring efficiency
5. **Explore the Revolution**: Interactive player comparison tool

## üõ† Technical Implementation

- **D3.js v7** for all visualizations and interactions
- **d3-annotation** for consistent chart annotations
- **Responsive design** with modern CSS styling
- **GitHub Pages** hosting
- **Pure JavaScript** - no frameworks or high-level visualization tools

## üìà Key Findings

- **3-point rate doubled**: From 18.7% (2004) to 39.5% (2024)
- **Mid-range decline**: From 35.6% (2004) to 11.2% (2024)
- **Efficiency gains**: League eFG% improved significantly
- **Player impact**: Stephen Curry's 402 made threes in 2015-16 epitomized the revolution
